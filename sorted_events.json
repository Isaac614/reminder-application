By the age of eighteen, I had moved twelve times. Our little houses, much like streaks of sagebrush\u2026 And new best friends, as if they were fence posts\u2026 Never really held a place in our minds, or hearts for that matter. Nothing stayed. None of the sweethearts, none of the schools, none of the smiles\u2026 It all flashed across the car window of my childhood like bolts of lightning in a summer storm. One moment you\u2019re there, then you blink and it\u2019s gone. Yet, as long as I can remember, no matter the city, no matter the school, one thing has always remained. Just above the fireplace, off to the left side, a little, worn, dusty clock sits comfortably. The dark, cracking wood, and the ever-so-faint numbers hint at the clock\u2019s age.\n\nWhen I was about six or seven, just figuring out my times tables, I finally decided to ask my father the question. I sat by him in our cozy new living room and asked, \u201cDad\u2026 why do we keep that old dusty clock around? It\u2019s really loud and kinda ugly.\u201d He paused for an extra long moment, making me worry I had hurt his feelings about the old thing. Then, his reply struck something in me like the string of a cello. He said, \u201c[son]\u2026 that beat-up little clock represents what makes this house our home.\u201d He then told me the story of our little, old, splintered clock. The story of a clock from Illinois, that made its way all the way to the west cost on a little run-down handcart. Through wind and rain, sun and stars, that little beat-up clock made it. Watching his family, clothes torn, shoes tearing, mother crying, as her boys try to be brave. But despite the sagebrush slipping past... Despite the fence grassy fields pleading them to stay... That clock trekked on. The broken, starving, exhausted family had a home, they had each other. And that little beat-up clock reminded them that. Even now, on that family\u2019s broken, twisty trail, despite our dry sagebrush and broken fence posts, despite moving houses and leaving best friends, we always have that clock. No matter how many cracks are in our woodwork, or how faded our numbers may appear, we have that dusty little clock. We have each other. And to me, a home without that, would simply be an empty house.",

At 5:15 p.m., the sunlight is a brutal contrast to the dimly lit halls of the school behind me. My eyes begin to focus, and the world slowly regains form. Chaos reigns on Massachusetts Avenue. Scores of musicians linger at this end of the block, and several non-Berklee pedestrians have to elbow their way past. Beyond the sidewalk, a disgruntled cab driver blasts his horn in frustration: rush hour is in full bloom.\n\nI turn to my right and start to head up Mass. Ave., following my carefully planned route back home. The wide sidewalk here allows for easy maneuvering around slower paced walkers, and I quickly approach the Boylston Street intersection. A young-looking guy skids towards me on a bicycle and asks if I\u2019ve read the Scriptures lately. Fortunately, the light is green, so I avoid the question and jog across the street.\n\nThis part of Mass Ave. passes over eight lanes of Mass Pike tollway. Several pedestrians quickly cover their ears as a construction drill below grinds away at broken pavement. I pass the four green \u2018T\u2019 stop doors, and a welcome rush of cold air gushes from inside the subway station. Tower Records stands just ahead, and several dozen people sit on the building\u2019s window ledges waiting for the bus.\u00a0An older man, probably in his seventies, stands up when two teenagers with multi-colored hair and nose rings crowd his perch. Two women eating ice cream discuss bathing suit sizes.\n\nSuddenly a very tall man wearing brand-new Nike shoes blocks my path and asks for some spare change. I try to mumble \u201csorry\u201d and walk around him, but the human traffic in this area is too congested to make an easy getaway. The panhandler persists, and I silently curse myself for getting caught off guard. I reach into my right pocket, grab a handful of change, gum wrappers, lint and God knows what else, and dump it in his cup. He praises me in the name of the Lord and moves on.\n\nAt Newbury Street I turn right. The sidewalk here is wider, so one can more easily weave in and out of the crowds of people. The concrete, patio-like area between Tower Records and JP Licks Ice Cream is always an interesting spot. Today a group of guys with mohawks, chains and tattoos licks ice cream cones near the back wall, while a long-haired woman wearing tie-dyed clothing sells beads at the edge. Further down the block another panhandler sings, dances, and shakes his change cup. He\u2019s loud enough almost to drown out the Roy Orbison tune blaring from a nearby apartment. Even so, no one pays attention to him.\n\nMany intriguing shops line the south side of Newbury Street, including Starbuck\u2019s Coffee, Patagonia Shoes, and Jean Pierre David Hair Salon. Just before I reach Newbury Comics, I cross the street to avoid the pesky Dianetics surveyors who hunt for prey outside the Boston Architectural Center. Sonsie Caf\u00e9, the artsy attraction on the North side of the street, employs a rather ragged-looking artist to stand in the outdoor section and paint. Today he\u2019s painting a colorful nude version of the two women dining closest to the sidewalk. They don\u2019t suspect a thing.\n\nIn order to avoid an annoyingly far-reaching sprinkling system, I cross Gloucester Avenue before turning left towards Commonwealth Avenue. Gloucester Avenue is a quiet side street lined with lofty old three-flats interrupted only by Public Alley #442, Several of the trees that stand between the parking meters have not been maintained very well: their low drooping branches force passersby to duck.\u00a0At the end of the block, a rusty old Boston Herald newspaper machine displays today\u2019s headline:\u00a0NY JET EXPLODES.\n\nLofty elm trees stand in front of the stony red buildings that line the southern side of Commonwealth Avenue., and one must walk nearer to the street to avoid several dog-walkers and stroller-pushers. To the left, a 100-foot wide park area divides the east and westbound lanes; Winston Churchill himself has declared this mall one of the world\u2019s most beautiful. Today, several dozen roller-bladers skate through the middle path, and the continuous line of shady trees protects them from the glaring sun.\n\nI live at 270 Commonwealth Avenue, a short walk from Gloucester Avenue. Several guitarists stand near the front door, with the gig bags slung over their shoulders. They look like long-haired soldiers casually guarding a musical fortress, and we exchange typical musician \u201chey-man\u201d greetings. My eight-and-a-half-minute journey ends as I begin to search in my right pocket for my suspiciously absent keys. \u2663\n\n(This example is taken from\u00a0http://readablewriting.com/discussion)",

As always, please bring a paper copy of your essay to class.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease see the examples below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nExample #1\n\nI couldn\u2019t breathe. If there was ever a time to quit, this was it.\n\nIt was an innocent conditioning drill. Two partners raced to a ball at the fifty yard line with incentive to win: the loser ran an extra one hundred yards. My partner was Kelly, one of the fastest girls on the team. It wasn\u2019t long before I was having an asthma attack.\n\nI often imagined myself wearing a varsity jacket with pride, but my field hockey coaches impeded my goal. They humiliated me on the field. They promoted freshmen to varsity and made me the ball girl. They told me I\u2019d \u201cnever be more than an okay player.\u201d When I crossed the end line after yet another one hundred yard punishment sprint, I\u2019d long since given up hope on my goal. The dream of a varsity jacket I could wear proudly had degraded to the dream of a varsity letter gathering dust in the attic. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I was nothing more than a senior in high school still playing junior varsity.\n\nCoach Bower called my name. I turned to her, holding my back erect and pressing my hands to my stomach, desperately trying to control the frantic nature of my breathing. She must have noticed the wheezing. She must have seen the tears threatening to spill from my panicked eyes.\n\n\u201cWalk to the stroke mark.\u201d She was giving me a six yard head start.\n\nI forced my body forward, head to the ground to hide the tears of shame that burned my eyes. There was dead silence behind me as my teammates stood in a uniform line and stared at my back.\n\n\u201cTake a few more steps.\u201d\n\nThe silence was broken by my own gasping sobs. This was more than embarrassment. This was abject humiliation.\n\nI could see my teammates out of the corner of my eye, whispering.\n\nCoach announced to the field: \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can give Kelly a challenge.\u201d\n\nMy hands shook with rage. I narrowed my eyes, glaring at the orange ball ahead of me. It suddenly didn\u2019t matter if it was forty-four yards or fifty yards or three miles away. I was going to get there first, or die trying. I rocked back and forth on the balls of my feet, wheezing, hiccupping, and waiting.\n\nShe blew the whistle.\n\nI clenched my teeth through the pain in my chest and sprinted, sobbing between gasping breaths. I beat Kelly by one step.\n\nDays later, I was finally given one chance to play varsity and prove myself to the same coaches who said I\u2019d never be \u201cmore than okay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before I was a varsity starter.\n\nI might have waited my whole life and never caught that lucky break necessary to capture my dreams, but it would have been impossible to succeed if I had given up before that chance came my way. There is no such thing as failure. There are only missed opportunities.\n\nExample #2\n\nLiving in the graffiti-adorned projects of the Lower East Side, I\u2019ve adjusted well to low-income living. Stuyvesant High School\u2019s done a first-rate job on making me feel like an outcast for it.\n\n\u201cYou can get a fee waiver once you give us a copy of your parent\u2019s 1040 tax forms,\u201d Ms. Cleary automatically explained.\n\n\u201cMy parents don\u2019t have tax forms,\u201d I said pointedly. \u201cThey don\u2019t fill them out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they file tax forms,\u201d she shot back. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d After a few more minutes of fruitless discussion, I left the College Office, unsuccessful. I would pay for SAT II exams, again.\n\nEven with fee waivers, applying to college is pricey. Sending test scores to more than 4 colleges cost money, AP exams fees are reduced but not obliterated, and I\u2019d love to meet the genius who thought of charging a fee for applying for financial aid. When approaching Ms. Cleary for help with the CCS Profile - I didn\u2019t know where to indicate welfare and food stamp income - she asked me which school I chose to apply to.\n\n\u201cM.I.T.,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cOh, M.I.T.?\u201d she mused. \u201cHow ironic, that you\u2019re applying to M.I.T. and yet you can\u2019t fill out a form\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t consider my school\u2019s administration supportive or welcoming.\n\nMy family felt strained enough paying $57 for senior dues when I attended middle school. Being a senior at Stuy is much, much worse. So far, this year\u2019s classes have demanded about $270 total in textbooks, workbooks, art supplies, and other expenses. When my teachers ask whether anyone will have trouble paying for their supplies, no one speaks up and an awkward silence ensues.\n\nWhile academic costs have mostly been waived, high school memories are not priceless. Yearbook photos just came in, and packages cost from $86 to about $230. I\u2019ll probably wear an old dress and take the subway to my senior prom, which will probably set me back another $160. I will not get a class ring.\n\nMany of my friends carry $10 and $20 daily, while I get $5 on a good day. Most of their parents are middle to upper class, working as teachers, lawyers, programmers, doctors, writers, social workers, or scientists, unlike my mother who is excused from work because of illness. Some of my classmates come from private schools, and many buy prep books for exams and have been in expensive SAT prep courses since middle school. They seem unable to comprehend my situation; the blank, baffled looks on their faces upon learning I have no cable television, cell phone, or air conditioning shock me.\n\n\u201cWe do it because we want you to be happy,\u201d my grandmother had explained to me when giving me $60 to attend a discounted college trip. Even in a nation governed by socioeconomic class, I believe that happiness and perseverance are enough for success. Although I use second-hand paints and brushes in acrylic painting class, I know that my painting will look just as striking.",

It can be more of a personal memoir or a personal essay.\n\n* The personal essay is written to offer insight into life.\n\n* The personal essay may be serious or humorous.\n\n* The personal essay wrestles with complex questions in life; it doesn\u2019t offer simplistic answers.\n\n* The personal essay is reflective in nature; even when writing about a past experience, the writer is thinking and commenting on the experience as he or she thinks about it today, not how he or she may have thought about it then.\n\n* The personal essay is not a research-driven essay; however, it may include outside sources, as necessary. Outside sources are informally referenced in the text of the essay.\n\nRubric\n\nScale\n\n1 = Weak\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 = Developing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 = Working\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 = Proficient\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 = Strong\n\n\u00a0\n\nAreas of Focus\n\nRating\n\nPurpose/Insight/Theme/Question\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No too preachy\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invites pondering\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nConflict vs. Crisis\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conflict/complexity is good\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple crisis is not good\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShow vs. Tell\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ladder of Abstraction\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effective ratio\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBeginning & Ending\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intriguing\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thoughtful\n\n\u00a0\n\nEngaging style/voice\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Personal\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effective\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormatting & Mechanics\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appropriate\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-distracting\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

Be sure to introduce each source and follow up after the quotation using the \"source sandwich method\" explained here:\n\n\u00a0https://vimeo.com/1022301659?share=copy\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs always, please bring a paper copy to workshop in class.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPresident Nelson's words:\n\nFirst: Know the truth about who you are.\u00a0I believe that if the Lord were speaking to you directly tonight, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity.[11] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note11)\u00a0My dear friends, you are literally spirit children of God. You have sung this truth since you learned the words to \u201cI Am a Child of God.\u201d[12] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note12)\u00a0But is that eternal truth imprinted upon your heart? Has this truth rescued you when confronted with temptation?[13] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note13)\n\nI fear that you may have heard this truth so often that it sounds more like a slogan than divine truth. And yet, the way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make.\n\nIn 2006, when I married Wendy, I was in for several surprises\u2014most of them quite wonderful. One of those surprises was the number of clothing items she owned that displayed a logo\u2014universities from which she graduated, places she had traveled, and so forth. Whenever she wore one of those items, I teased her by saying, \u201cWho are you advertising today?\u201d She invited me to join in the fun!\n\n[Russell M. Nelson] (https://assets.ldscdn.org/25/6e/256e0dacca14eb2077475a80c44c02c9a38a373d/russell_m_nelson.png)\n\nLabels\u00a0can\u00a0be fun and indicate your support for any number of positive things. Many labels will change for you with the passage of time. And not all labels are of equal value. But if any label replaces your most important identifiers, the results can be spiritually suffocating.\n\nFor example, if I were to rank in order of importance the designations that could be applied to me, I would say: First, I am a child of God\u2014a son of God\u2014then a son of the covenant, then a disciple of Jesus Christ and a devoted member of His restored Church.\n\nNext would come my honored titles as a husband and father, then Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nAll other labels that have applied to me\u2014such as a medical doctor, surgeon, researcher, professor, lieutenant, captain, PhD, American, and so forth\u2014would fall somewhere down the list.\n\nNow, let us turn the question to you.\u00a0Who are you?\n\nFirst and foremost, you are a child of God.\n\nSecond, as a member of the Church, you are a child of the covenant. And third, you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.\n\nTonight, I plead with you not to\u00a0replace\u00a0these three paramount and unchanging identifiers with any others, because doing so could stymie your progress or pigeonhole you in a stereotype that could potentially thwart your eternal progression.\n\nFor example, if you are identified mainly as an American, those who are not Americans may think, \u201cI know everything there is to know about you\u201d and attribute erroneous beliefs to you.\n\nIf you identify yourself by your political affiliation, you will instantly be categorized as having certain beliefs\u2014though I don\u2019t know anyone who believes everything that their preferred political party presently embraces.\n\nWe could go on and on, rehearsing the constraints of various labels that we put on ourselves or that other people place upon us.\n\nSome might label me as an \u201cold man.\u201d But I\u2019m a lot younger than Adam was\u2014and Noah too.[14] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note14)\u00a0Ageism, racism, nationalism, sexism, and a host of other \u201cisms\u201d are universally limiting.\n\nHow tragic it is when someone believes the label another person has given them. Imagine the heartache of a child who is told, \u201cYou are dumb.\u201d Identifiers and labels are powerful!\n\nThe adversary rejoices in labels because they divide us and restrict the way we think about ourselves and each other. How sad it is when we honor labels more than we honor each other.\n\nLabels can lead to judging and animosity. Any\u00a0abuse\u00a0or\u00a0prejudice\u00a0toward another because of nationality, race, sexual orientation, gender, educational degrees, culture, or other significant identifiers is offensive to our Maker! Such mistreatment causes us to live beneath our stature as His covenant sons and daughters!\n\nThere are various labels that may be very important to you, of course. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that other designations and identifiers are not significant. I am simply saying that no identifier should\u00a0displace,\u00a0replace, or\u00a0take priority over\u00a0these three enduring designations: \u201cchild of God,\u201d \u201cchild of the covenant,\u201d and \u201cdisciple of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAny identifier that is not compatible with these three basic designations will ultimately let you down. Other labels will disappoint you in time because they do not have the power to lead you toward eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.\n\nWorldly identifiers will\u00a0never\u00a0give you a vision of who you can ultimately become. They will never affirm your divine DNA or your unlimited, divine potential.\n\nBecause there is a grand plan of salvation authored by Heavenly Father, does it not stand to reason that you also have a divine destiny?[15] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note15)\n\nMake no mistake about it: Your potential is divine. With your diligent seeking, God will give you glimpses of who you may become.\n\nSo who are you? First and foremost, you are a child of God, a child of the covenant, and a disciple of Jesus Christ. As you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.",

Search \u201c30-day experiment\u201d on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results.\u00a0\n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts, you\u2019ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs, as well as find out more information about how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format\u2014like a typical lab report, but with narrative elements.\n\n\u00a0\n\nResearch Requirements\u00a0\n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you did, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results were, and compare your results to theirs).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle\u00a0\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nScholar\n\nLibrary Website\n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMethods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people\u2019s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n\u00a0\n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction\u00a0\n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods\u00a0\n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself\u00a0\n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the experiment, you might explain it here, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results\u00a0\n\n* Present, with vivid details, a few select and important events of the experiment\u00a0\n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. \u201cI did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.\u201d)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion\u00a0\n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of, start doing something you feel you don\u2019t do enough of, or do something you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n\u00a0\n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in your notes, remember that the more often you write about your experiences during the experiment, the better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhatever you choose to do, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00a0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Finish your homework early each day, or study at a consistent time before relaxing\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n\u00a0\n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\n-------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\u00a0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\u00a0\n\n--------------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Search \u201c30-day experiment\u201d on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results.\u00a0\n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts, you\u2019ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs, as well as find out more information about how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format\u2014like a typical lab report, but with narrative elements.\n\n\u00a0\n\nResearch Requirements\u00a0\n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you did, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results were, and compare your results to theirs).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle\u00a0\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\n\u00a0\n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMethods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people\u2019s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n\u00a0\n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction\u00a0\n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods\u00a0\n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself\u00a0\n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the experiment, you might explain it here, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results\u00a0\n\n* Present, with vivid details, a few select and important events of the experiment\u00a0\n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. \u201cI did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.\u201d)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion\u00a0\n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of, start doing something you feel you don\u2019t do enough of, or do something you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n\u00a0\n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in your notes, remember that the more often you write about your experiences during the experiment, the better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhatever you choose to do, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00a0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\n\u00a0\n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\n-------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\u00a0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\u00a0\n\n--------------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

Do some general research on Google or Wikipedia to learn more about your topic.\u00a0\n\nThen, write 1-2 pages about the background of your topic, common arguments you have heard, and questions that you want to answer. You could also write about how your topic fits with the five stasis points.\n\nFor example, if you chose to write about homeschooling, you might include these questions and your initial answers:\n\nFacts: How many children are being homeschooled in the USA?\n\nDefinition: What counts as home-schooling? What about online schools, dual-enrollment, etc.\u00a0\n\nCause/effect: Why is homeschooling becoming more popular?\u00a0\n\nEvaluation: Does homeschooling help or harm kids academically? Does it help or harm kids socially?\n\nProposal: Should there be more government oversight for homeschooling? Should parents get tax money to help them educate their kids? Should parents choose homeschooling?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs always, bring a paper copy to class.\n\nHere are some topics that you might want to choose, but you are not limited to these options:\n\n-Is online dating a good way to meet a spouse?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n-Is it better to grow up with lots of siblings or few siblings?\n\n-Is it better to get married at a younger age or an older age?\u00a0\n\n-What are the solutions to the drug and Fentanyl problems in the US?\n\n-Should transgender athletes compete with female athletes?\u00a0\n\n-Should states ban hormone blockers, cross-sex hormones, and/or sex-change surgeries for minors?\u00a0\n\n-What can be done about illegal immigration?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n-Should the federal government forgive student loan debt?\u00a0\n\n-What is the value of a college degree?\u00a0\n\n-Is nuclear power safe and effective, or should nuclear power plants be shut down?\u00a0\n\n-What are the effects of smartphones, screen time, and/or social media on mental health?\n\n-Is physical discipline like spanking effective in parenting?\n\n-Should marijuana be legalized recreationally in every state?\u00a0\n\n-Should we raise the federal minimum wage to $15?\n\n-Should states ban abortion? If so, at what stage in the pregnancy? How should abortion laws be enforced?\u00a0\n\n-Should colleges practice affirmative action in admissions? Should employers use affirmative action in hiring?\u00a0\n\n-What is the best solution for homelessness? Is \"housing first\" a good policy?\u00a0\n\n-What is the best solution to crime? What are the merits of criminal justice reform, bail reform, and \"harm reduction\" policies?\u00a0\n\n-Should California and other states ban the sale of new gas cars by 2035? Should the government continue to subsidize the sale of electric vehicles with tax breaks?\u00a0\n\n-Should the government subsidize the sale of solar panels for homeowners?\u00a0\n\n-What are the effects of religion on teenagers and young adults?\u00a0\n\n-Should all states ban minors from tanning beds?\u00a0\n\n-Should social media platforms censor speech? Should hate speech be banned? Should certain books be taken out of school libraries?\u00a0\n\n-Is homeschooling good for kids?\u00a0\n\n-What are the benefits or harms of standardized testing?\u00a0\n\n-What forms of exercise are the most effective? Is weight training more effective than aerobic exercise? What about things like HIT, supplements, etc.?\u00a0\n\n-What are the effects of gratitude on happiness?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

You must use at least one quote from L. Lennie Irvin's \"What Is 'Academic' Writing?\" and one quote from E. Shelley Reid\u2019s \u201cTen Ways to Think About Writing: Metaphoric Musings for College Writing Students.\u201d You are, of course, welcome to include more than just one quote from each article and to summarize or paraphrase ideas from the articles as well.\n\n*\n\n* [What Is Academic Writing_Irvin_ENG150 Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015482?wrap=1)\u00a0\n\n* [Ten Ways To Think About Writing_Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015484?wrap=1)\u00a0\n\n* Begin writing a 1.5\u20132 page reflection paper. Follow these instructions as you do so:\n\n* Write a rough draft or outline of your reflection. There are many ways to organize a reflection essay, but the basic organization should include the following.\n\n* Introduction: Describe your mindset at the beginning of ENG 150, and share some of the misconceptions or initial concerns you may have had. You may or may not use a quote as part of the introduction.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe what you learned and how it helped you overcome a misconception or concern about writing. You may or may not incorporate a quote from an outside source here, but you will need to include two quotes from different sources somewhere in the reflection.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe another thing you learned and how it helped you overcome either the same misconception/concern or a different misconception/concern about writing.\n\n* More Body Paragraphs: Add more descriptions of your learning and growth as needed/desired.\n\n* Conclusion: Briefly summarize the most important things you learned, and describe how you plan to use what you've learned beyond this class. In other words, how has this class helped you to be an effective communicator in future writing situations?\n\n* Last, but not least, consider formatting. What have you learned about expectations for academic style (usually MLA or APA)? What have you learned about citing sources?\u00a0 Be sure to show (and not just tell) your instructor what you\u2019ve learned.\n\n* Submit your completed reflection by the due date.\n\nHelpful Hints\n-------------\n\n* Be sure to support your ideas about learning to write in ENG 150 with meaningful and specific evidence from your experiences in the course. In other words, don't just say, \"This class taught me how to write.\" Instead, give specific examples of what you didn't know (or thought you knew) and then describe how and why you changed throughout the semester. Be sure to mention specifics like assigned readings, homework, conferences, and other activities that either helped (or didn't help) you along the way.\n\n* Be sure to format the citations correctly at the end of your essay. The final citations for the articles should look like this:\n\nAPA Format\n\nIrvin, L. L. (2010). What is \"academic\" writing? In C. Lowe and P.

Follow the individual instructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific grading criteria, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/341216/files/147260780/preview) \u00a0button at the top of this window and choose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n--------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mountain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Add the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and put it in bold font. See example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \"Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\"\u20131 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn't focused on before. Nephi isn't just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he's blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn't just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain time).\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate's post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture, or a quote from a church leader and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi's case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \"had traveled three days in the wilderness . . .\" But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \"came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\" (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \"about 180 miles through a hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\" Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \"at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\" This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate's post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can either share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that's 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I've shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete.",

This should include a scripture passage or prophetic quote, and your explanation of why it is important or how it is relevant in your life.\n\n* Share your insight! You could talk with a friend, Skype your family, call your grandma, post something on social media, send someone a letter or email, or make a blog entry. Try to generate a discussion with others about what you shared and why it is important.\n\n* Reflect and report on your experience. Download and complete the [Share It!
