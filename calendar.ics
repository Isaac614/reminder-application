 d a place in our minds\, or hearts for that matter. Nothing stayed. None o

 ’s really loud and kinda ugly.” He paused for an extra long moment\, m
 aking me worry I had hurt his feelings about the old thing. Then\, his rep
 ly struck something in me like the string of a cello. He said\, “[son]
 … that beat-up little clock represents what makes this house our home.
 ” He then told me the story of our little\, old\, splintered clock. The 
 story of a clock from Illinois\, that made its way all the way to the west
  cost on a little run-down handcart. Through wind and rain\, sun and stars
 \, that little beat-up clock made it. Watching his family\, clothes torn\,
  shoes tearing\, mother crying\, as her boys try to be brave. But despite 
 the sagebrush slipping past... Despite the fence grassy fields pleading th
 em to stay... That clock trekked on. The broken\, starving\, exhausted fam
 ily had a home\, they had each other. And that little beat-up clock remind
 ed them that. Even now\, on that family’s broken\, twisty trail\, despit
 e our dry sagebrush and broken fence posts\, despite moving houses and lea
 ving best friends\, we always have that clock. No matter how many cracks a
 re in our woodwork\, or how faded our numbers may appear\, we have that du
 sty little clock. We have each other. And to me\, a home without that\, wo
 uld simply be an empty house.

 /p>\n<p>&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\; &nbsp\;&nbsp\;&n
 bsp\; My childhood was a lot like a trip down an interstate highway\, pass
 ing smudged sagebrush and blurred fence posts\, flicking past the window i
 n a senseless blur. By the age of eighteen\, I had moved twelve times. Our
  little houses\, much like streaks of sagebrush… And new best friends\, 
 as if they were fence posts… Never really held a place in our minds\, or
  hearts for that matter. Nothing stayed. None of the sweethearts\, none of
  the schools\, none of the smiles… It all flashed across the car window 
 of my childhood like bolts of lightning in a summer storm. One moment you
 ’re there\, then you blink and it’s gone. Yet\, as long as I can remem
 ber\, no matter the city\, no matter the school\, one thing has always rem
 ained. Just above the fireplace\, off to the left side\, a little\, worn\,
  dusty clock sits comfortably. The dark\, cracking wood\, and the ever-so-
 faint numbers hint at the clock’s age.</p>\n<p>When I was about six or s
 even\, just figuring out my times tables\, I finally decided to ask my fat
 her the question. I sat by him in our cozy new living room and asked\, “
 Dad… why do we keep that old dusty clock around? It’s really loud and 
 kinda ugly.” He paused for an extra long moment\, making me worry I had 
 hurt his feelings about the old thing. Then\, his reply struck something i
 n me like the string of a cello. He said\, “[son]… that beat-up little
  clock represents what makes this house our home.” He then told me the s
 tory of our little\, old\, splintered clock. The story of a clock from Ill
 inois\, that made its way all the way to the west cost on a little run-dow
 n handcart. Through wind and rain\, sun and stars\, that little beat-up cl
 ock made it. Watching his family\, clothes torn\, shoes tearing\, mother c
 rying\, as her boys try to be brave. But despite the sagebrush slipping pa
 st... Despite the fence grassy fields pleading them to stay... That clock 
 trekked on. The broken\, starving\, exhausted family had a home\, they had
  each other. And that little beat-up clock reminded them that. Even now\, 
 on that family’s broken\, twisty trail\, despite our dry sagebrush and b
 roken fence posts\, despite moving houses and leaving best friends\, we al
 ways have that clock. No matter how many cracks are in our woodwork\, or h

DESCRIPTION:Write 1-2 pages (250-500 words) narrating your walk home from s
 chool. As always\, use MLA format and bring a paper copy to class. \n\nYo
 u should stay in the past tense--i.e. "I trudged up the hill towards my do
 rm\," not "I trudge up the hill towards my dorm." \n\nTry to use only kin
 etic verbs that show motion\, not "to be" verbs like "is\, am\, are\, was\
 , were\, be\, being\, and been." For example\, "Dirt streaked the snow\," 
 not "The snow was dirty"\;  "The apartment building squatted on the hill\
 ," not "The apartment building was on the hill."\n\nTry to include lots of
  concrete\, specific nouns and quality adjectives--i. e. "By the cracked s
 idewalk\, a patch of grass withered in the heat of the September afternoon
 . Fat grasshoppers leaped off the sidewalk like burnt-yellow springs aroun
 d my feet." Avoid generalities and weak adjectives--i. e. "I saw grass tha
 t looks very dry as I walk down the sidewalk\, and there were lots of bugs
  jumping out of my way as I approached them. \n\nFinally\, try to tell a 
 story with a beginning\, middle\, and end.. \n\nSee "A Walk Home" below a
 n example of an excellent student paper. \n\n \n\nAs always\, bring a ph
 ysical copy of your paper to class. \n\n \n\n“Going Home” \n\nI bur
 st from the front doors of Berklee and immediately stop and blink. At 5:15
  p.m.\, the sunlight is a brutal contrast to the dimly lit halls of the sc
 hool behind me. My eyes begin to focus\, and the world slowly regains form
 . Chaos reigns on Massachusetts Avenue. Scores of musicians linger at this
  end of the block\, and several non-Berklee pedestrians have to elbow thei
 r way past. Beyond the sidewalk\, a disgruntled cab driver blasts his horn
  in frustration: rush hour is in full bloom.\n\nI turn to my right and sta
 rt to head up Mass. Ave.\, following my carefully planned route back home.
  The wide sidewalk here allows for easy maneuvering around slower paced wa
 lkers\, and I quickly approach the Boylston Street intersection. A young-l
 ooking guy skids towards me on a bicycle and asks if I’ve read the Scrip
 tures lately. Fortunately\, the light is green\, so I avoid the question a
 nd jog across the street.\n\nThis part of Mass Ave. passes over eight lane
 s of Mass Pike tollway. Several pedestrians quickly cover their ears as a 
 construction drill below grinds away at broken pavement. I pass the four g
 reen ‘T’ stop doors\, and a welcome rush of cold air gushes from insid
 e the subway station. Tower Records stands just ahead\, and several dozen 
 people sit on the building’s window ledges waiting for the bus. An olde
 r man\, probably in his seventies\, stands up when two teenagers with mult
 i-colored hair and nose rings crowd his perch. Two women eating ice cream 
 discuss bathing suit sizes.\n\nSuddenly a very tall man wearing brand-new 
 Nike shoes blocks my path and asks for some spare change. I try to mumble 
 “sorry” and walk around him\, but the human traffic in this area is to
 o congested to make an easy getaway. The panhandler persists\, and I silen
 tly curse myself for getting caught off guard. I reach into my right pocke
 t\, grab a handful of change\, gum wrappers\, lint and God knows what else
 \, and dump it in his cup. He praises me in the name of the Lord and moves
  on.\n\nAt Newbury Street I turn right. The sidewalk here is wider\, so on
 e can more easily weave in and out of the crowds of people. The concrete\,
  patio-like area between Tower Records and JP Licks Ice Cream is always an
  interesting spot. Today a group of guys with mohawks\, chains and tattoos
  licks ice cream cones near the back wall\, while a long-haired woman wear

 the south side of Newbury Street\, including Starbuck’s Coffee\, Patagon

 omics\, I cross the street to avoid the pesky Dianetics surveyors who hunt

 . They don’t suspect a thing.\n\nIn order to avoid an annoyingly far-rea
 ching sprinkling system\, I cross Gloucester Avenue before turning left to
 wards Commonwealth Avenue. Gloucester Avenue is a quiet side street lined 
 with lofty old three-flats interrupted only by Public Alley #442\, Several
  of the trees that stand between the parking meters have not been maintain
 ed very well: their low drooping branches force passersby to duck. At the
  end of the block\, a rusty old Boston Herald newspaper machine displays t
 oday’s headline: NY JET EXPLODES.\n\nLofty elm trees stand in front of 
 the stony red buildings that line the southern side of Commonwealth Avenue
 .\, and one must walk nearer to the street to avoid several dog-walkers an
 d stroller-pushers. To the left\, a 100-foot wide park area divides the ea
 st and westbound lanes\; Winston Churchill himself has declared this mall 
 one of the world’s most beautiful. Today\, several dozen roller-bladers 
 skate through the middle path\, and the continuous line of shady trees pro
 tects them from the glaring sun.\n\nI live at 270 Commonwealth Avenue\, a 
 short walk from Gloucester Avenue. Several guitarists stand near the front
  door\, with the gig bags slung over their shoulders. They look like long-
 haired soldiers casually guarding a musical fortress\, and we exchange typ
 ical musician “hey-man” greetings. My eight-and-a-half-minute journey

  pages (250-500 words) narrating your walk home from school. As always\, u
 se MLA format and bring a paper copy to class.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>You should s
 tay in the past tense--i.e. "I trudg<strong>ed</strong> up the hill toward
 s my dorm\," not "I trudge up the hill towards my dorm."&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>Tr
 y to use only kinetic verbs that show motion\, not "to be" verbs like "is\
 , am\, are\, was\, were\, be\, being\, and been." For example\, "Dirt stre
 aked the snow\," not "The snow was dirty"\; &nbsp\;"The apartment building
  squatted on the hill\," not "The apartment building was on the hill."</p>
 \n<p>Try to include lots of concrete\, specific nouns and quality adjectiv
 es--i. e. "By the cracked sidewalk\, a patch of grass withered in the heat
  of the September afternoon. Fat grasshoppers leaped off the sidewalk like
  burnt-yellow springs around my feet." Avoid generalities and weak adjecti
 ves--i. e. "I saw grass that looks very dry as I walk down the sidewalk\, 
 and there were lots of bugs jumping out of my way as I approached them.&nb
 sp\;</p>\n<p>Finally\, try to tell a story with a beginning\, middle\, and
  end..&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>See "A Walk Home" below an example of an excellent s
 tudent paper.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>As always\, bring a physical 
 copy of your paper to class.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p><strong>“Goi
 ng Home”&nbsp\;</strong></p>\n<p>I burst from the front doors of Berklee
  and immediately stop and blink. At 5:15 p.m.\, the sunlight is a brutal c
 ontrast to the dimly lit halls of the school behind me. My eyes begin to f
 ocus\, and the world slowly regains form. Chaos reigns on Massachusetts Av
 enue. Scores of musicians linger at this end of the block\, and several no
 n-Berklee pedestrians have to elbow their way past. Beyond the sidewalk\, 
 a disgruntled cab driver blasts his horn in frustration: rush hour is in f
 ull bloom.</p>\n<p>I turn to my right and start to head up Mass. Ave.\, fo
 llowing my carefully planned route back home. The wide sidewalk here allow
 s for easy maneuvering around slower paced walkers\, and I quickly approac
 h the Boylston Street intersection. A young-looking guy skids towards me o
 n a bicycle and asks if I’ve read the Scriptures lately. Fortunately\, t
 he light is green\, so I avoid the question and jog across the street.</p>
 \n<p>This part of Mass Ave. passes over eight lanes of Mass Pike tollway. 
 Several pedestrians quickly cover their ears as a construction drill below
  grinds away at broken pavement. I pass the four green ‘T’ stop doors\
 , and a welcome rush of cold air gushes from inside the subway station. To
 wer Records stands just ahead\, and several dozen people sit on the buildi
 ng’s window ledges waiting for the bus.&nbsp\;An older man\, probably in
  his seventies\, stands up when two teenagers with multi-colored hair and 
 nose rings crowd his perch. Two women eating ice cream discuss bathing sui
 t sizes.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a very tall man wearing brand-new Nike shoes blo
 cks my path and asks for some spare change. I try to mumble “sorry” an
 d walk around him\, but the human traffic in this area is too congested to
  make an easy getaway. The panhandler persists\, and I silently curse myse
 lf for getting caught off guard. I reach into my right pocket\, grab a han
 dful of change\, gum wrappers\, lint and God knows what else\, and dump it
  in his cup. He praises me in the name of the Lord and moves on.</p>\n<p>A
 t Newbury Street I turn right. The sidewalk here is wider\, so one can mor
 e easily weave in and out of the crowds of people. The concrete\, patio-li
 ke area between Tower Records and JP Licks Ice Cream is always an interest
 ing spot. Today a group of guys with mohawks\, chains and tattoos licks ic
 e cream cones near the back wall\, while a long-haired woman wearing tie-d

 ndler sings\, dances\, and shakes his change cup. He’s loud enough almos
 t to drown out the Roy Orbison tune blaring from a nearby apartment. Even 
 so\, no one pays attention to him.</p>\n<p>Many intriguing shops line the

DESCRIPTION:--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opp
 ortunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your class
 mates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week\, desig
 ned to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the s
 criptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discu
 ssion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussio
 n fall on the same days as other activities this week\, each post in this 
 discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be
  most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstruction
 s\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity\, you will share three post
 s throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual ins
 tructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific gra
 ding criteria\, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses
 /341216/files/147260780/preview)  button at the top of this window and ch
 oose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n-------------------------
 -\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningf
 ul for you and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mo
 untain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from th
 e assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Add the refer
 ence to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n
 \n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and put it in bol
 d font. See example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its sig
 nificance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: "Therefore go\, my so
 n\, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured."
 –1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7\, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time\
 , I noticed something I hadn't focused on before. Nephi isn't just blessed
  for being willing to return to Jerusalem\; he's blessed because he does s
 o with a good attitude. After all\, Laman and Lemuel make the trip\, but t
 hey do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn't just
  completing the action the Lord requires\, like going home teaching\, he a
 lso requires that we obey with the right attitude\, like going home teachi
 ng joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n \n\nPost 02 Inc
 reased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n---
 ---------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your cl
 assmates\, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain time).\n\nFor 
 the second post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Try to add further
  insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by
  sharing a related scripture\, or a quote from a church leader and then ex
 plaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the s
 cripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: 
 This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a diff
 icult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi's case\, I learned
  something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how gre
 at his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought 
 it was a three-day trip one way because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi 
 "had traveled three days in the wilderness . . ." But the Institute Manual
  pointed out that Lehi and his family first "came down by the borders near
  the shore of the Red Sea" (1 Nephi 5:6)\, which is "about 180 miles throu
 gh a hot\, barren country infested anciently by many marauders." Combined 
 with three days of traveling in the wilderness\, this means that the whole
  trip was "at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way." This was not a
 n easy task\, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his g
 reat faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to
  tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n \n\nPost 03 Personal App
 lication\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFo
 r the third post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Pick a post that 
 you can make a personal application to. You can either share a brief story
  of when you have seen that principle in your life\, identify a way you ar
 e currently trying to live that principle or share an example of a friend 
 or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n--
 -----\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first b
 een asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly b
 eing asked to travel back 14 days\, retrieve something we left behind\, an
 d then being asked to return for another 14-day trip—that's 42 days of t
 raveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenienc
 e. In my life\, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like tha
 t\, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that somet
 imes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me sin
 ce I have very little free time as a student right now. However\, I know t
 hat when I have a good attitude about this assignment\, it has helped me t
 o love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I've shared mess
 ages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient\, but it will alw
 ays be the right thing to do.\n\n \n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instr
 uctions in this activity before considering it complete.

 inning\, a middle\, and an end. The story should have some kind of tension
  that builds up into a climax. \n\nFor example\, if you wrote that you go
 t hurt playing sports and the recovery was hard\, that wouldn't be a compl
 ete story. There are only two things\, and the one doesn't build up to the
  other. \n\nInstead you could write that you were (1) cocky about being t
 he star of the team\, but then (2) you got hurt and had to (3) learn to hu
 mbly cheer on your team from the sidelines. \n\nYou need to connect the e
 vents of your story in a meaningful way. We should see how one thing leads
  to the next and how these events impacted you. \n\nOne way is to think o
 f the beginning as a goal\, the middle as an obstacle\, and the end as the
  resolution. For example\, (1) you wanted to win the debate competition\, 
 but (2) your teammates didn't believe in you\, so (3) you practiced with y
 our family and proved to everyone that you could do it. \n\n

DESCRIPTION:Use this prompt to write a 250-650 word essay that could be use
 d for admission to college\, graduate school\, or a job. \n\nWhat is one 
 of the most difficult things you have ever done or experienced? What did y
 ou learn from it?\n\nWrite a story with a beginning\, middle\, and end. Tr
 y to use concrete nouns\, quotations\, names\, and interesting verbs to sh
 ow the details of your experience in a vivid way. As always\, please bring
  a paper copy of your essay to class. \n\n \n\nPlease see the examples b
 elow.\n\n \n\nExample #1\n\nI couldn’t breathe. If there was ever a tim
 e to quit\, this was it.\n\nIt was an innocent conditioning drill. Two par
 tners raced to a ball at the fifty yard line with incentive to win: the lo
 ser ran an extra one hundred yards. My partner was Kelly\, one of the fast
 est girls on the team. It wasn’t long before I was having an asthma atta
 ck.\n\nI often imagined myself wearing a varsity jacket with pride\, but m
 y field hockey coaches impeded my goal. They humiliated me on the field. T
 hey promoted freshmen to varsity and made me the ball girl. They told me I
 ’d “never be more than an okay player.” When I crossed the end line 
 after yet another one hundred yard punishment sprint\, I’d long since gi
 ven up hope on my goal. The dream of a varsity jacket I could wear proudly
  had degraded to the dream of a varsity letter gathering dust in the attic
 . After years of sacrifice and hard work\, I was nothing more than a senio
 r in high school still playing junior varsity.\n\nCoach Bower called my na
 me. I turned to her\, holding my back erect and pressing my hands to my st
 omach\, desperately trying to control the frantic nature of my breathing. 
 She must have noticed the wheezing. She must have seen the tears threateni
 ng to spill from my panicked eyes.\n\n“Walk to the stroke mark.” She w
 as giving me a six yard head start.\n\nI forced my body forward\, head to 
 the ground to hide the tears of shame that burned my eyes. There was dead 
 silence behind me as my teammates stood in a uniform line and stared at my
  back.\n\n“Take a few more steps.”\n\nThe silence was broken by my own
  gasping sobs. This was more than embarrassment. This was abject humiliati
 on.\n\nI could see my teammates out of the corner of my eye\, whispering.\
 n\nCoach announced to the field: “Let’s see if we can give Kelly a cha
 llenge.”\n\nMy hands shook with rage. I narrowed my eyes\, glaring at th
 e orange ball ahead of me. It suddenly didn’t matter if it was forty-fou
 r yards or fifty yards or three miles away. I was going to get there first
 \, or die trying. I rocked back and forth on the balls of my feet\, wheezi
 ng\, hiccupping\, and waiting.\n\nShe blew the whistle.\n\nI clenched my t
 eeth through the pain in my chest and sprinted\, sobbing between gasping b
 reaths. I beat Kelly by one step.\n\nDays later\, I was finally given one 
 chance to play varsity and prove myself to the same coaches who said I’d
  never be “more than okay.” It wasn’t long before I was a varsity st
 arter.\n\nI might have waited my whole life and never caught that lucky br
 eak necessary to capture my dreams\, but it would have been impossible to 
 succeed if I had given up before that chance came my way. There is no such
  thing as failure. There are only missed opportunities.\n\nExample #2\n\nL
 iving in the graffiti-adorned projects of the Lower East Side\, I’ve adj
 usted well to low-income living. Stuyvesant High School’s done a first-r
 ate job on making me feel like an outcast for it.\n\n“You can get a fee 
 waiver once you give us a copy of your parent’s 1040 tax forms\,” Ms. 
 Cleary automatically explained.\n\n“My parents don’t have tax forms\,
 ” I said pointedly. “They don’t fill them out.”\n\n“Of course th
 ey file tax forms\,” she shot back. “Everyone does.” After a few mor
 e minutes of fruitless discussion\, I left the College Office\, unsuccessf
 ul. I would pay for SAT II exams\, again.\n\nEven with fee waivers\, apply
 ing to college is pricey. Sending test scores to more than 4 colleges cost
  money\, AP exams fees are reduced but not obliterated\, and I’d love to
  meet the genius who thought of charging a fee for applying for financial 
 aid. When approaching Ms. Cleary for help with the CCS Profile - I didn’
 t know where to indicate welfare and food stamp income - she asked me whic
 h school I chose to apply to.\n\n“M.I.T.\,” I replied.\n\n“Oh\, M.I.
 T.?” she mused. “How ironic\, that you’re applying to M.I.T. and yet
  you can’t fill out a form…” I don’t consider my school’s admini
 stration supportive or welcoming.\n\nMy family felt strained enough paying
  $57 for senior dues when I attended middle school. Being a senior at Stuy
  is much\, much worse. So far\, this year’s classes have demanded about 
 $270 total in textbooks\, workbooks\, art supplies\, and other expenses. W
 hen my teachers ask whether anyone will have trouble paying for their supp
 lies\, no one speaks up and an awkward silence ensues.\n\nWhile academic c
 osts have mostly been waived\, high school memories are not priceless. Yea
 rbook photos just came in\, and packages cost from $86 to about $230. I’
 ll probably wear an old dress and take the subway to my senior prom\, whic
 h will probably set me back another $160. I will not get a class ring.\n\n
 Many of my friends carry $10 and $20 daily\, while I get $5 on a good day.
  Most of their parents are middle to upper class\, working as teachers\, l
 awyers\, programmers\, doctors\, writers\, social workers\, or scientists\
 , unlike my mother who is excused from work because of illness. Some of my
  classmates come from private schools\, and many buy prep books for exams 
 and have been in expensive SAT prep courses since middle school. They seem
  unable to comprehend my situation\; the blank\, baffled looks on their fa
 ces upon learning I have no cable television\, cell phone\, or air conditi
 oning shock me.\n\n“We do it because we want you to be happy\,” my gra
 ndmother had explained to me when giving me $60 to attend a discounted col
 lege trip. Even in a nation governed by socioeconomic class\, I believe th
 at happiness and perseverance are enough for success. Although I use secon
 d-hand paints and brushes in acrylic painting class\, I know that my paint
 ing will look just as striking.

DESCRIPTION:Write a 2-3 page essay on the topic of identity and the gospel.
  \n\nStart by reading the section of President Nelson's devotional addres
 s from May 15\, 2022\, titled "First\, know the truth about who you are." 
 I have included the section below\, and here is the link to the full  add
 ress: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devot
 ional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng \n\nThen write your thou
 ghts about why it is important to remember our most significant identities
  instead of focusing on identities like race\, gender\, or sexual orientat
 ion. \n\nYou should use at least two quotations in this paper. They can b
 e from President Nelson's talk or any other source. Be sure to introduce e
 ach source and follow up after the quotation using the "source sandwich me
 thod" explained here:\n\n https://vimeo.com/1022301659?share=copy \n\n 
 \n\nAs always\, please bring a paper copy to workshop in class. \n\n \n\
 nPresident Nelson's words:\n\nFirst: Know the truth about who you are. I 
 believe that if the Lord were speaking to you directly tonight\, the first
  thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity.[11] (https
 ://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-y
 oung-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note11) My dear friends\, you are l
 iterally spirit children of God. You have sung this truth since you learne
 d the words to “I Am a Child of God.”[12] (https://www.churchofjesusch
 rist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12
 nelson?lang=eng#note12) But is that eternal truth imprinted upon your hea
 rt? Has this truth rescued you when confronted with temptation?[13] (https
 ://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-y
 oung-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note13)\n\nI fear that you may have 
 heard this truth so often that it sounds more like a slogan than divine tr
 uth. And yet\, the way you think about who you really are affects almost e
 very decision you will ever make.\n\nIn 2006\, when I married Wendy\, I wa
 s in for several surprises—most of them quite wonderful. One of those su
 rprises was the number of clothing items she owned that displayed a logo
 —universities from which she graduated\, places she had traveled\, and s
 o forth. Whenever she wore one of those items\, I teased her by saying\, 
 “Who are you advertising today?” She invited me to join in the fun!\n\
 n[Russell M. Nelson] (https://assets.ldscdn.org/25/6e/256e0dacca14eb207747
 5a80c44c02c9a38a373d/russell_m_nelson.png)\n\nLabels can be fun and indi
 cate your support for any number of positive things. Many labels will chan
 ge for you with the passage of time. And not all labels are of equal value
 . But if any label replaces your most important identifiers\, the results 
 can be spiritually suffocating.\n\nFor example\, if I were to rank in orde
 r of importance the designations that could be applied to me\, I would say
 : First\, I am a child of God—a son of God—then a son of the covenant\
 , then a disciple of Jesus Christ and a devoted member of His restored Chu
 rch.\n\nNext would come my honored titles as a husband and father\, then A
 postle of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nAll other labels that have applied to 
 me—such as a medical doctor\, surgeon\, researcher\, professor\, lieuten
 ant\, captain\, PhD\, American\, and so forth—would fall somewhere down 
 the list.\n\nNow\, let us turn the question to you. Who are you?\n\nFirst
  and foremost\, you are a child of God.\n\nSecond\, as a member of the Chu
 rch\, you are a child of the covenant. And third\, you are a disciple of J
 esus Christ.\n\nTonight\, I plead with you not to replace these three pa
 ramount and unchanging identifiers with any others\, because doing so coul
 d stymie your progress or pigeonhole you in a stereotype that could potent
 ially thwart your eternal progression.\n\nFor example\, if you are identif
 ied mainly as an American\, those who are not Americans may think\, “I k
 now everything there is to know about you” and attribute erroneous belie
 fs to you.\n\nIf you identify yourself by your political affiliation\, you
  will instantly be categorized as having certain beliefs—though I don’
 t know anyone who believes everything that their preferred political party
  presently embraces.\n\nWe could go on and on\, rehearsing the constraints
  of various labels that we put on ourselves or that other people place upo
 n us.\n\nSome might label me as an “old man.” But I’m a lot younger 
 than Adam was—and Noah too.[14] (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/stu
 dy/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=
 eng#note14) Ageism\, racism\, nationalism\, sexism\, and a host of other 
 “isms” are universally limiting.\n\nHow tragic it is when someone beli
 eves the label another person has given them. Imagine the heartache of a c
 hild who is told\, “You are dumb.” Identifiers and labels are powerful
 !\n\nThe adversary rejoices in labels because they divide us and restrict 
 the way we think about ourselves and each other. How sad it is when we hon
 or labels more than we honor each other.\n\nLabels can lead to judging and
  animosity. Any abuse or prejudice toward another because of nationali
 ty\, race\, sexual orientation\, gender\, educational degrees\, culture\, 
 or other significant identifiers is offensive to our Maker! Such mistreatm
 ent causes us to live beneath our stature as His covenant sons and daughte
 rs!\n\nThere are various labels that may be very important to you\, of cou
 rse. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that other designatio
 ns and identifiers are not significant. I am simply saying that no identif
 ier should displace\, replace\, or take priority over these three endu
 ring designations: “child of God\,” “child of the covenant\,” and 
 “disciple of Jesus Christ.”\n\nAny identifier that is not compatible w
 ith these three basic designations will ultimately let you down. Other lab
 els will disappoint you in time because they do not have the power to lead
  you toward eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.\n\nWorldly ident
 ifiers will never give you a vision of who you can ultimately become. Th
 ey will never affirm your divine DNA or your unlimited\, divine potential.
 \n\nBecause there is a grand plan of salvation authored by Heavenly Father
 \, does it not stand to reason that you also have a divine destiny?[15] (h
 ttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-f
 or-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng#note15)\n\nMake no mistake about
  it: Your potential is divine. With your diligent seeking\, God will give 
 you glimpses of who you may become.\n\nSo who are you? First and foremost\
 , you are a child of God\, a child of the covenant\, and a disciple of Jes
 us Christ. As you embrace these truths\, our Heavenly Father will help you
  reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.

 talk. You may want to consider writing about the hard question of why bad 
 things happen to good people. Include things like personal stories\, examp
 les from the scriptures\, parables\, metaphors\, quotes from General Confe
 rence\, and testimony to make your talk interesting\, memorable\, and pers
 uasive. \n\nFor this talk\, think about applying the principles of good w
 riting that we learned this semester.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Write a kind of 
 thesis statement to use at the start of your talk to share your main point
 . For example\, you could say\, "To me\, faith means trust. I trust God be
 cause of what He has done for me\, and I focus on being faithful to Him."
  \n\n-Make the stories or parables vivid with concrete nouns\, kinetic ve
 rbs\, names\, and dialogue.\n\n-Use the "source sandwich" method to introd
 uce and follow up on your quotations.\n\nAs always\, please bring a paper 
 copy so we can review it in class.

DESCRIPTION:For this assignment\, write a roughly 3-4 page (roughly 750-100
 0 words) sacrament meeting talk. You may choose any gospel topic for your 
 talk. You may want to consider writing about the hard question of why bad 
 things happen to good people. Include things like personal stories\, examp
 les from the scriptures\, parables\, metaphors\, quotes from General Confe
 rence\, and testimony to make your talk interesting\, memorable\, and pers
 uasive. \n\nFor this talk\, think about applying the principles of good w
 riting that we learned this semester.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Write a kind of 
 thesis statement to use at the start of your talk to share your main point
 . For example\, you could say\, "To me\, faith means trust. I trust God be
 cause of what He has done for me\, and I focus on being faithful to Him."
  \n\n-Make the stories or parables vivid with concrete nouns\, kinetic ve
 rbs\, names\, and dialogue.\n\n-Use the "source sandwich" method to introd
 uce and follow up on your quotations.

 ******************\nAssignment Sheet - ENG 150\n**************************
 \n\n-----------------\nVital Information\n-----------------\n\nAudience: Y
 our Instructor and your peers\n\nPurpose: To practice gathering primary an
 d secondary research and then synthesizing that data into a coherent narra
 tive/reflective essay\n\nGenre: Experiential essay in a modified IMRD form
 at\n\nStance: Fun but scientific and reliable\n\nMedium: Multimedia alphab
 etic text (may also images and other media)\n\nLength: Roughly 1250-1750 w
 ords\n\nProposal due: Week 7\n\nExperiment duration: Two weeks\n\n \n\n--
 -------------------\nAssignment Background\n---------------------\n\nA pop
 ular genre in contemporary non-fiction is the short-term personal experime
 nt report. Search “30-day experiment” on youtube or google and you wil
 l find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to im
 prove and then reporting on the results. \n\n---------\nYour Task\n------
 ---\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will n
 eed to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary
  research experiment. Before the experiment starts\, you’ll make predict
 ions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks\, you 
 will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also re
 search if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare
  your results to theirs\, as well as find out more information about how a
 nd why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects o
 ther people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 125
 0-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction\, Meth
 ods\, Results\, Discussion) format—like a typical lab report\, but with 
 narrative elements.\n\n \n\nResearch Requirements \n--------------------
 --\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and inco
 rporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing 
 something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your
  experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically
  affected by doing what you did\, and (3) experiences of other people who 
 have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened durin
 g their experiment and what their results were\, and compare your results 
 to theirs). \n\n \n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it w
 ill be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoog

 be\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(
 methods)\n\n \n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction \n\n
 * Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research 
 (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the 
 reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you c
 ould have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about
  what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to
  them.\n\n* Methods \n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you establi
 shed for yourself \n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the exp
 eriment\, you might explain it here\, or you might save that for later in 
 the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chos
 e it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question\, tell them what 
 you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Re
 sults \n\n* Present\, with vivid details\, a few select and important eve
 nts of the experiment \n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of t
 he entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available 
 (e.g. “I did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experim
 ent.”)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where
  you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experim
 ent\n\n* Discussion \n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the exp
 eriment\n\n* Don’t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (ma
 ke guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implica
 tions for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you n
 eeded to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to s
 top or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and
  experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours\, and co
 mpare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relati
 onship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nC
 hoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment\, 
 you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much
  of\, start doing something you feel you don’t do enough of\, or do some
 thing you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be 
 transparent about your efforts\, you will want to choose something that a 
 camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n \n\nEach experience you have dur
 ing your experiment is worthy of writing about\, even (maybe especially) y
 our failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in
  your notes\, remember that the more often you write about your experience
 s during the experiment\, the better your final piece will be. Most studen
 ts write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the e
 xperiment.\n\n \n\nWhatever you choose to do\, realize that it is going t
 o (and should) disrupt your life\, and that you are going to have to make 
 accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are 
 choosing to add something to your life\, you are going to have to give up 
 something else\; likewise\, if you are trying to take something out of you
 r life\, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that sp
 ace. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had 
 to make in order to change this part of your life up. \n\nHere are some e
 xamples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Finish your homework earl
 y each day\, or study at a consistent time before relaxing\n\n-Do a random
  act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member
  through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do anothe
 r form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each 
 day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\
 n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the ground
 s\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social medi
 a each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day
 . For example\, try drawing something every day or play the violin each da
 y if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day li
 ke 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\
 n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a med
 itation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n \n\n-------------------\nManaging

 -------------------------------------------------\nThere are many options 
 for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one fi
 le where you will keep your notes\, or use a note taking program like Goog
 le Keep or something similar. If you write on paper\, you could use a spir
 al-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose pap
 er really quickly myself\, so I am not going to do that.) The important th
 ing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your no
 tes\, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up w
 ith a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring you
 r notes\, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that. \n-

 ’ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to d

 --\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research
  (your own experiences)\, and secondary research (the experiences and rese
 arch of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous
  in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-
 text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate qu
 otes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester\, and include
  an MLA works cited page.\n-----------------------------------------------

 <span>A popular genre in contemporary non-fiction is the short-term person
 al experiment report. Search “30-day experiment” on youtube or google 
 and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an e
 ffort to improve and then reporting on the results.&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<h2
 ><span>Your Task</span></h2>\n<p><span>For this assignment you will be doi
 ng something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary ev
 ery day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experimen
 t starts\, you’ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect 
 you. During the two weeks\, you will keep a journal of field notes about y
 our experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same o
 r similar experiment and compare your results to theirs\, as well as find 
 out more information about how and why making this change matters or could
  affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn 
 your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay writ
 ten in IMRD (Introduction\, Methods\, Results\, Discussion) format—like 
 a typical lab report\, but with narrative elements.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp\;
 </p>\n<h3><strong>Research Requirements&nbsp\;</strong></h3>\n<p><span>The
 re are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate i
 nto this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something
  similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experien
 ce in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected
  by doing what you did\, and (3) experiences of other people who have done
  something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their e
 xperiment and what their results were\, and compare your results to theirs
 ).&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<

  need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of\, st
 art doing something you feel you don’t do enough of\, or do something yo
 u currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transpar
 ent about your efforts\, you will want to choose something that a camera c
 ould see you doing (or not).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p><span>Each exp
 erience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about\, even 
 (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for h
 ow much you write in your notes\, remember that the more often you write a
 bout your experiences during the experiment\, the better your final piece 
 will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over
  the course of the experiment.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p><span>Whatev
 er you choose to do\, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt you
 r life\, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that di
 sruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something 
 to your life\, you are going to have to give up something else\; likewise\
 , if you are trying to take something out of your life\, you are going to 
 have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion secti
 on should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change
  this part of your life up.&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<div class="byui fdeng301-w

 *******************\nChange Something Up Research Essay \n***************
 ********************\n\n**************************\nAssignment Sheet - ENG
  150\n**************************\n\n-----------------\nVital Information\n
 -----------------\n\nAudience: Your Instructor and your peers\n\nPurpose: 
 To practice gathering primary and secondary research and then synthesizing
  that data into a coherent narrative/reflective essay\n\nGenre: Experienti
 al essay in a modified IMRD format\n\nStance: Fun but scientific and relia
 ble\n\nMedium: Multimedia alphabetic text (may also images and other media
 )\n\nLength: Roughly 1250-1750 words\n\nExperiment duration: Two weeks\n\
 n \n\n---------------------\nAssignment Background\n---------------------
 \n\nA popular genre in contemporary non-fiction is the short-term personal
  experiment report. Search “30-day experiment” on youtube or google an
 d you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an eff
 ort to improve and then reporting on the results. \n\n---------\nYour Tas
 k\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: Y
 ou will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as 
 a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts\, you’ll mak
 e predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two wee
 ks\, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You wil
 l also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment an
 d compare your results to theirs\, as well as find out more information ab
 out how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it 
 affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a ro
 ughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introducti
 on\, Methods\, Results\, Discussion) format—like a typical lab report\, 
 but with narrative elements.\n\n \n\nResearch Requirements \n-----------
 -----------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find
  and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people a
 re doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to
  put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are 
 typically affected by doing what you did\, and (3) experiences of other pe
 ople who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happe
 ned during their experiment and what their results were\, and compare your
  results to theirs). \n\n \n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nW
 here it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatist
 a\n\nGoogle \n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nGoogle Schola
 r\n\n \n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMet
 hods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people’s experiences\n\nYo
 uTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n
 \n(methods)\n\n \n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction \
 n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and resear
 ch (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give t
 he reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things yo
 u could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea ab
 out what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept
  to them.\n\n* Methods \n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you esta
 blished for yourself \n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the 
 experiment\, you might explain it here\, or you might save that for later 
 in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you c
 hose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question\, tell them wh
 at you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n*
  Results \n\n* Present\, with vivid details\, a few select and important 
 events of the experiment \n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview o
 f the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them availab
 le (e.g. “I did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the expe
 riment.”)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments wh
 ere you learned something about life or about yourself because of the expe
 riment\n\n* Discussion \n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the 
 experiment\n\n* Don’t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate 
 (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the impl
 ications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs yo
 u needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have t
 o stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results 
 and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours\, and
  compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your rel
 ationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------
 \nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment
 \, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too m
 uch of\, start doing something you feel you don’t do enough of\, or do s
 omething you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to 
 be transparent about your efforts\, you will want to choose something that
  a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n \n\nEach experience you have 
 during your experiment is worthy of writing about\, even (maybe especially
 ) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write
  in your notes\, remember that the more often you write about your experie
 nces during the experiment\, the better your final piece will be. Most stu
 dents write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of th
 e experiment.\n\n \n\nWhatever you choose to do\, realize that it is goin
 g to (and should) disrupt your life\, and that you are going to have to ma
 ke accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you a
 re choosing to add something to your life\, you are going to have to give 
 up something else\; likewise\, if you are trying to take something out of 
 your life\, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that
  space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you h
 ad to make in order to change this part of your life up. \n\nHere are som
 e examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You
  could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of 
 service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through
  a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form o
 f exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-
 Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go t
 o the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Po
 st your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each d
 ay\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For ex
 ample\, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you
  have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 wo
 rds of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 1
 4-day social media fast\n\n \n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\
 n-------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping
  track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where yo
 u will keep your notes\, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or 
 something similar. If you write on paper\, you could use a spiral-bound no
 tebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really q
 uickly myself\, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to k
 eep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes\, writi
 ng your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse
  final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes\, s
 o make sure you have them in a format that works for that. \n------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --\n\nIn your notes\, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts\,
  lasts\, mosts\, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why y
 ou choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also\, you’ll want n
 otes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do\, and also
  from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life. \n\n-----
 ---------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-----------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is 
 a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own e
 xperiences)\, and secondary research (the experiences and research of othe
 rs). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in represen
 ting where your outside information is coming from through in-text citatio
 ns and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using M
 LA formatting we have been learning all semester\, and include an MLA work
 s cited page.\n-----------------------------------------------------------

 <h2><span>Managing Your Notes</span></h2>\n<h2><span>There are many option
 s for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one 
 file where you will keep your notes\, or use a note taking program like Go
 ogle Keep or something similar. If you write on paper\, you could use a sp
 iral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose p
 aper really quickly myself\, so I am not going to do that.) The important 
 thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your 
 notes\, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up
  with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring y
 our notes\, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.&nb
 sp\;</span></h2>\n<p><span>In your notes\, you will want to record meaning
 ful moments: firsts\, lasts\, mosts\, when things feel new or difficult or
  easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. A
 lso\, you’ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you c
 hose to do\, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of 
 your life.&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Use of Sources</span></h2>\n<h2><s
 pan>This is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research
  (your own experiences)\, and secondary research (the experiences and rese
 arch of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous
  in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-
 text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate qu
 otes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester\, and include
  an MLA works cited page.</span></h2><script src="https://instructure-uplo

 ---------------\nVital Information\n-----------------\n\nAudience: Your In
 structor and your peers\n\nPurpose: To practice gathering primary and seco
 ndary research and then synthesizing that data into a coherent narrative/r
 eflective essay\n\nGenre: Experiential essay in a modified IMRD format\n\n
 Stance: Fun but scientific and reliable\n\nMedium: Multimedia alphabetic t
 ext (may also images and other media)\n\nLength: Roughly 1250-1750 words\n
 \nExperiment duration: Two weeks\n\n \n\n---------------------\nAssignme
 nt Background\n---------------------\n\nA popular genre in contemporary no
 n-fiction is the short-term personal experiment report. Search “30-day e
 xperiment” on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of p
 eople changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on t
 he results. \n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment yo
 u will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of th
 e ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before 
 the experiment starts\, you’ll make predictions about how the experiment
  will affect you. During the two weeks\, you will keep a journal of field 
 notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tri
 ed the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs\, as 
 well as find out more information about how and why making this change mat
 ters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You wi
 ll then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective resear
 ch essay written in IMRD (Introduction\, Methods\, Results\, Discussion) f
 ormat—like a typical lab report\, but with narrative elements.\n\n \n\n
 Research Requirements \n----------------------\n\nThere are three types o
 f sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment:
  (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you
  did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) sc
 ientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you d
 id\, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar t
 o your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what t
 heir results were\, and compare your results to theirs). \n\n \n\nResear

 \n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n \n\nEssay Struc
 ture\n---------------\n\n* Introduction \n\n* Give background of your pre
 vious experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that 
 contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chos
 e this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember 
 to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up e
 xperiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods \n\n* Ex
 plain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself \n\n* If y
 our rules changed at any point during the experiment\, you might explain i
 t here\, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell
  what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also brin
 g up your research question\, tell them what you specifically decided to p
 ay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results \n\n* Present\, with v
 ivid details\, a few select and important events of the experiment \n\n* 
 Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give
  any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. “I did my experiment 
 successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.”)\n\n* Present mini-st
 ories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about 
 life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion \n\n* Re
 flect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don’t introduc
 e any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succ
 eeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on 
 the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to mak
 e the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order t
 o be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else w
 ho did a similar experiment to yours\, and compare your results to theirs\
 n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be 
 moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n----
 --------------------\n\nFor the experiment\, you will need to either stop 
 doing something you feel that you do too much of\, start doing something y
 ou feel you don’t do enough of\, or do something you currently do alread
 y in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your effort
 s\, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (o
 r not).\n\n \n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy
  of writing about\, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there 
 are no requirements for how much you write in your notes\, remember that t
 he more often you write about your experiences during the experiment\, the
  better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 
 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n \n\nWhatever 
 you choose to do\, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your l
 ife\, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disru
 ption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to 
 your life\, you are going to have to give up something else\; likewise\, i
 f you are trying to take something out of your life\, you are going to hav
 e to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section 
 should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change th
 is part of your life up. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your jo
 urnal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like
  Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect wit
 h an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go fo
 r a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5
  things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and g
 et to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an o
 rdinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form t
 hrough a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a
  hobby you have forgotten each day. For example\, try drawing something ev
 ery day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n
 \n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memoriz
 e a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\nManag
 ing Your Notes\n\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day 
 experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes
 \, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If 
 you write on paper\, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journa
 l especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself\, so I a
 m not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes saf
 e for the whole time. If you lose your notes\, writing your paper will be 
 extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We wil
 l have a day in class where you bring your notes\, so make sure you have t
 hem in a format that works for that.\n\nIn your notes\, you will want to r
 ecord meaningful moments: firsts\, lasts\, mosts\, when things feel new or
  difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment o
 r recommit. Also\, you’ll want notes from when you are actually doing th
 e thing you chose to do\, and also from when you see it have effects in ot
 her parts of your life.\n\nUse of Sources\n\nThis is a research assignment
 . You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences)\, and sec
 ondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job
  with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outsi
 de information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic 
 references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have
  been learning all semester\, and include an MLA works cited page.\n\n \n

 </span><br><br><span>There are many options for keeping track of your 14-d
 ay experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your no
 tes\, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. 
 If you write on paper\, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound jou
 rnal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself\, so 
 I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes 
 safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes\, writing your paper will 
 be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We 
 will have a day in class where you bring your notes\, so make sure you hav
 e them in a format that works for that.</span><br><br><span>In your notes\
 , you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts\, lasts\, mosts\, whe
 n things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up
  on the experiment or recommit. Also\, you’ll want notes from when you a
 re actually doing the thing you chose to do\, and also from when you see i
 t have effects in other parts of your life.</span><br><br><span>Use of Sou
 rces</span><br><br><span>This is a research assignment. You will be doing 
 both primary research (your own experiences)\, and secondary research (the
  experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignmen
 t is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is co
 ming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will
  need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all s
 emester\, and include an MLA works cited page.</span>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp\;<

DESCRIPTION:For this short writing exercise\, read this article by Prof. Br
 ad Wilcox on marriage and children:\n\n[The Two-Parent Advantage | City Jo
 urnal (city-journal.org)] (https://www.city-journal.org/article/the-two-pa
 rent-advantage) \n\nThen\, write a summary in a table format with 16 rows
 \, one for each paragraph. There should be two columns in your table\, lik
 e the one below. Label the left column "Says" and the right column "Does."
  Then write a summary of what each paragraph says in the left column boxes
 . In the right column boxes\, describe what that paragraph does in the ess
 ay. What move is the author making in that paragraph? I have filled in the
  first couple of boxes to help you get started.\n\nYou can copy and paste

 dience: English 150 Instructor\n\n* Purpose: Demonstrate your ability to (
 1) integrate sources according to academic standards and (2) analyze your 
 experience with the writing process in ENG 150\, and (3) provide evidence 
 for how this course helped you become a more effective communicator.\n\n* 
 Length: 300-550 words (about 1.5-2 pages)\n\n------------\nInstructions\n-
 -----------\n\n* Brainstorm a response to the following questions:\n\n* Wh
 at misconceptions or concerns did you have about writing before taking ENG
  150?\n\n* What have you learned this semester about the writing process?\
 n\n* What have you learned about how to be an effective communicator?\n\n*
  Study the following resources and choose quotes that connect with your le
 arning experience in ENG 150. You must use at least one quote from L. Lenn
 ie Irvin's "What Is 'Academic' Writing?" and one quote from E. Shelley Rei
 d’s “Ten Ways to Think About Writing: Metaphoric Musings for College W
 riting Students.” You are\, of course\, welcome to include more than jus
 t one quote from each article and to summarize or paraphrase ideas from th
 e articles as well.\n\n*\n\n* [What Is Academic Writing_Irvin_ENG150 Commo

 these instructions as you do so:\n\n* Write a rough draft or outline of yo
 ur reflection. There are many ways to organize a reflection essay\, but th
 e basic organization should include the following.\n\n* Introduction: Desc
 ribe your mindset at the beginning of ENG 150\, and share some of the misc
 onceptions or initial concerns you may have had. You may or may not use a 
 quote as part of the introduction.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe what you 
 learned and how it helped you overcome a misconception or concern about wr
 iting. You may or may not incorporate a quote from an outside source here\
 , but you will need to include two quotes from different sources somewhere
  in the reflection.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe another thing you learne
 d and how it helped you overcome either the same misconception/concern or 
 a different misconception/concern about writing.\n\n* More Body Paragraphs
 : Add more descriptions of your learning and growth as needed/desired.\n\n
 * Conclusion: Briefly summarize the most important things you learned\, an
 d describe how you plan to use what you've learned beyond this class. In o
 ther words\, how has this class helped you to be an effective communicator
  in future writing situations?\n\n* Last\, but not least\, consider format
 ting. What have you learned about expectations for academic style (usually
  MLA or APA)? What have you learned about citing sources?  Be sure to sho
 w (and not just tell) your instructor what you’ve learned.\n\n* Submit y
 our completed reflection by the due date.\n\nHelpful Hints\n-------------\
 n\n* Be sure to support your ideas about learning to write in ENG 150 with
  meaningful and specific evidence from your experiences in the course. In 
 other words\, don't just say\, "This class taught me how to write." Instea
 d\, give specific examples of what you didn't know (or thought you knew) a
 nd then describe how and why you changed throughout the semester. Be sure 
 to mention specifics like assigned readings\, homework\, conferences\, and
  other activities that either helped (or didn't help) you along the way.\n
 \n* Be sure to format the citations correctly at the end of your essay. Th
 e final citations for the articles should look like this:\n\nAPA Format\n\

 n</li>\n<li>Last\, but not least\, consider formatting. What have you lear
 ned about expectations for academic style (usually MLA or APA)? What have 
 you learned about citing sources?&nbsp\; Be sure to show (and not just tel

 <hr>\n<h3>Helpful Hints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to support your ideas abou
 t learning to write in ENG 150 with meaningful and specific evidence from 
 your experiences in the course. In other words\, don't just say\, "This cl
 ass taught me how to write." Instead\, give specific examples of what you 
 didn't know (or thought you knew) and then describe how and why you change
 d throughout the semester. Be sure to mention specifics like assigned read
 ings\, homework\, conferences\, and other activities that either helped (o
 r didn't help) you along the way.</li>\n<li>Be sure to format the citation
 s correctly at the end of your essay. The final citations for the articles
  should look like this:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="padding-left: 40px\;"><stro
